<h1> Cat-Photo-App </h1>

<h2>Project Description </h2>
The application is a demonstration using html and css to build a webpage outline that focuses on cats within replit. It displays varied text formats, images and descriptors, links to other pages, lists and a footer. 

Replit was used to write the code as it allowed me to use an IDE rather than on my own device. This made it easier to practice my skills. In addition, html and css has been used as to build the structure and bring the webpage in to fruition while allowing to build on my understanding of web applications. 

Some of the challenges faced while building the application was making sure the indentations were not only correct for the program to work but for the code to be more readable. It is my understanding that this comes with practice which is something I am hoping to improve on as I build more applications.

In the future I hope to implement this onto a Django webpage with multiple pages displaying varying information and formats.

<h2> How to Run the Project </h2>
A link to run on replit has been provided, though it is currently coming up with errors which are to be fixed. 

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/SabinaMcG99/Cat-Photo-App.git)](https://repl.it/github/SabinaMcG99/Cat-Photo-App.git)

If you do not wish to run from this link, the alternative is to create your own application with html and css on replit, putting the code into the index.html file and running on your own replit account. 

Alternatively, if you wish  to learn how all of the page works step by step I would recommend going onto the FreeCodeCamp certification of Web Developmenet and selecting on the "create a cat photo app" task.

<h2> How to Use the Project </h2>
To run the project on replit, once the link works, is very simple. All it takes it clicking the play button at the top of the page and selecting the output tab on the left hand size to view the page.
